It comprises dispatch \\nnetwork nodes and dispatch network lines.  Most dispatch network nodes will \\nnot have market transactions occurring at them because there will be no \\ngenerators or consumers at those dispatch network nodes.  A separate set of \\nnodes, called market network nodes, is described below.  The market \\nnetwork nodes correspond to nodes at which market transactions occur.  A \\nmarket network node could be defined to be a dispatch network node, or \\nthere could be several market network nodes (representing different facilities \\noffering into the market) at a single dispatch network node.  While the \\nMarket Clearing Engine explicitly represents dispatch network nodes when \\ndetermining power flows etc, the market network node prices are derived as \\npart of a post-processing exercise.  These rules allow the flexibility to define \\nmarket network nodes in many different ways. \\nThe dispatch network will be based on EMS data, but the rules and systems \\ndo allow (but do not require) simplifications in this representation if this is \\nconsidered desirable (e.g. to make the software run faster). \\n2.1.1 \\nThe EMC shall establish, prior to the market commencement date and in \\nconsultation with the PSO, and shall thereafter maintain and, in \\nconsultation with the PSO, update as required, requirements for dispatch \\nnetwork data, which requirements shall be consistent with the equations \\ndescribing the dispatch network in Appendix 6D, and shall communicate \\nsuch requirements and updated requirements to the PSO. \\n2.1.2 \\nThe PSO shall establish, prior to the market commencement date and in \\nconsultation with the EMC, and shall thereafter maintain and, in \\nconsultation with the EMC, update as required dispatch network data \\nconsistent with the requirements for dispatch network data specified by \\nthe EMC pursuant to section 2.1.1. Such dispatch network data shall \\ncomprise a representation of all dispatch network lines, dispatch network \\nnodes and facilities forming part of or connected to the PSO controlled \\nsystem which: \\n2.1.2.1 \\nthe PSO considers may be connected in such a manner as to \\nmaterially affect the dispatch of facilities pursuant to this \\nChapter; or \\n2.1.2.2 \\nthe EMC requires to be included for purposes of the \\noperation of the real-time markets. \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Chapter 6 Market Operation 1Jan24.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Chapter 6 Market Operation 1Jan24.pdf', 'page': 10, 'total_pages': 61, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Singapore Electricity Market Rules', 'author': 'Energy Market Authority', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word', 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 23.6.156', 'creationDate': \"D:20231222113214+08'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20231222113234+08'00'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content='Singapore Electricity Market Rules \\nEnergy \\nChapter 6 \\nMarket \\n1 January 2024 \\nAuthority \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 10 \\n2.1.3 \\nDispatch network lines and dispatch network nodes need not correspond \\nexactly to physical electricity lines or nodes.

It comprises dispatch \\nnetwork nodes and dispatch network lines.  Most dispatch network nodes will \\nnot have market transactions occurring at them because there will be no \\ngenerators or consumers at those dispatch network nodes.  A separate set of \\nnodes, called market network nodes, is described below.  The market \\nnetwork nodes correspond to nodes at which market transactions occur.  A \\nmarket network node could be defined to be a dispatch network node, or \\nthere could be several market network nodes (representing different facilities \\noffering into the market) at a single dispatch network node.  While the \\nMarket Clearing Engine explicitly represents dispatch network nodes when \\ndetermining power flows etc, the market network node prices are derived as \\npart of a post-processing exercise.  These rules allow the flexibility to define \\nmarket network nodes in many different ways. \\nThe dispatch network will be based on EMS data, but the rules and systems \\ndo allow (but do not require) simplifications in this representation if this is \\nconsidered desirable (e.g. to make the software run faster). \\n2.1.1 The EMC shall establish, prior to the market commencement date and in \\nconsultation with the PSO, and shall thereafter maintain and, in \\nconsultation with the PSO, update as required, requirements for dispatch \\nnetwork data, which requirements shall be consistent with the equations \\ndescribing the dispatch network in Appendix 6D, and shall communicate \\nsuch requirements and updated requirements to the PSO. \\n2.1.2 The PSO shall establish, prior to the market commencement date and in \\nconsultation with the EMC, and shall thereafter maintain and, in \\nconsultation with the EMC, update as required dispatch network data \\nconsistent with the requirements for dispatch network data specified by the \\nEMC pursuant to section 2.1.1. Such dispatch network data shall comprise \\na representation of all dispatch network lines, dispatch network nodes and \\nfacilities forming part of or connected to the PSO controlled system which: \\n2.1.2.1 \\nthe PSO considers may be connected in such a manner as to \\nmaterially affect the dispatch of facilities pursuant to this \\nChapter; or \\n2.1.2.2 \\nthe EMC requires to be included for purposes of the operation \\nof the real-time markets. \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Chapter 6 Market Operation 1Jan25.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Chapter 6 Market Operation 1Jan25.pdf', 'page': 10, 'total_pages': 60, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Singapore Electricity Market Rules', 'author': 'Energy Market Authority', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 24 for Word', 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 24.5.96', 'creationDate': \"D:20241218150523+08'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20241218150537+08'00'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content='Singapore Electricity Market Rules \\nEnergy \\nChapter 6 \\nMarket \\n1 January 2025 \\nAuthority \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 10 \\n2.1.3 Dispatch network lines and dispatch network nodes need not correspond \\nexactly to physical electricity lines or nodes.

It comprises dispatch\\nnetwork nodes and dispatch network lines. Most dispatch network nodes will\\nnot have market transactions occurring at them because there will be no\\ngenerators or consumers at those dispatch network nodes. A separate set of\\nnodes, called market network nodes, is described below. The market\\nnetwork nodes correspond to nodes at which market transactions occur. A\\nmarket network node could be defined to be a dispatch network node, or\\nthere could be several market network nodes (representing different facilities\\noffering into the market) at a single dispatch network node. While the\\nMarket Clearing Engine explicitly represents dispatch network nodes when\\ndetermining power flows etc, the market network node prices are derived as\\npart of a post-processing exercise. These rules allow the flexibility to define\\nmarket network nodes in many different ways.\\nThe dispatch network will be based on EMS data, but the rules and systems\\ndo allow (but do not require) simplifications in this representation if this is\\nconsidered desirable (e.g. to make the software run faster).\\n2.1.1 The EMC shall establish, prior to the market commencement date and in\\nconsultation with the PSO, and shall thereafter maintain and, in\\nconsultation with the PSO, update as required, requirements for dispatch\\nnetwork data, which requirements shall be consistent with the equations\\ndescribing the dispatch network in Appendix 6D, and shall communicate\\nsuch requirements and updated requirements to the PSO.\\n2.1.2 The PSO shall establish, prior to the market commencement date and in\\nconsultation with the EMC, and shall thereafter maintain and, in\\nconsultation with the EMC, update as required dispatch network data\\nconsistent with the requirements for dispatch network data specified by\\nthe EMC pursuant to section 2.1.1. Such dispatch network data shall\\ncomprise a representation of all dispatch network lines, dispatch network\\nnodes and facilities forming part of or connected to the PSO controlled\\nsystem which:\\n2.1.2.1 the PSO considers may be connected in such a manner as to\\nmaterially affect the dispatch of facilities pursuant to this\\nChapter; or\\n2.1.2.2 the EMC requires to be included for purposes of the\\noperation of the real-time markets.\\nPage 9\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Chapter 6 Market Operation 1Jan24.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Chapter 6 Market Operation 1Jan24.pdf', 'page': 10, 'total_pages': 61, 'Author': 'Energy Market Authority', 'Chapter Number': 'Chapter 6', 'Client': 'Energy Market Authority', 'Company': '', 'CreationDate': \"D:20231222113214+08'00'\", 'Creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word', 'Date': '10 January 2002', 'Keywords': '', 'ModDate': \"D:20231222113234+08'00'\", 'Producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 23.6.156', 'Project': 'Singapore Electricity Market Rules', 'SourceModified': 'D:20231221012102', 'Status': 'Release 3.0c', 'Subject': '', 'Title': 'Singapore Electricity Market Rules'}, page_content='Singapore Electricity Market Rules Energy\\nChapter 6 Market\\n1 January 2024 Authority\\n2.1.3 Dispatch network lines and dispatch network nodes need not correspond\\nexactly to physical electricity lines or nodes.

It comprises dispatch\\nnetwork nodes and dispatch network lines. Most dispatch network nodes will\\nnot have market transactions occurring at them because there will be no\\ngenerators or consumers at those dispatch network nodes. A separate set of\\nnodes, called market network nodes, is described below. The market\\nnetwork nodes correspond to nodes at which market transactions occur. A\\nmarket network node could be defined to be a dispatch network node, or\\nthere could be several market network nodes (representing different facilities\\noffering into the market) at a single dispatch network node. While the\\nMarket Clearing Engine explicitly represents dispatch network nodes when\\ndetermining power flows etc, the market network node prices are derived as\\npart of a post-processing exercise. These rules allow the flexibility to define\\nmarket network nodes in many different ways.\\nThe dispatch network will be based on EMS data, but the rules and systems\\ndo allow (but do not require) simplifications in this representation if this is\\nconsidered desirable (e.g. to make the software run faster).\\n2.1.1 The EMC shall establish, prior to the market commencement date and in\\nconsultation with the PSO, and shall thereafter maintain and, in\\nconsultation with the PSO, update as required, requirements for dispatch\\nnetwork data, which requirements shall be consistent with the equations\\ndescribing the dispatch network in Appendix 6D, and shall communicate\\nsuch requirements and updated requirements to the PSO.\\n2.1.2 The PSO shall establish, prior to the market commencement date and in\\nconsultation with the EMC, and shall thereafter maintain and, in\\nconsultation with the EMC, update as required dispatch network data\\nconsistent with the requirements for dispatch network data specified by the\\nEMC pursuant to section 2.1.1. Such dispatch network data shall comprise\\na representation of all dispatch network lines, dispatch network nodes and\\nfacilities forming part of or connected to the PSO controlled system which:\\n2.1.2.1 the PSO considers may be connected in such a manner as to\\nmaterially affect the dispatch of facilities pursuant to this\\nChapter; or\\n2.1.2.2 the EMC requires to be included for purposes of the operation\\nof the real-time markets.\\nPage 9\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Chapter 6 Market Operation 1Jan25.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Chapter 6 Market Operation 1Jan25.pdf', 'page': 10, 'total_pages': 60, 'Author': 'Energy Market Authority', 'Chapter Number': 'Chapter 6', 'Client': 'Energy Market Authority', 'Company': '', 'CreationDate': \"D:20241218150523+08'00'\", 'Creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 24 for Word', 'Date': '10 January 2002', 'Keywords': '', 'ModDate': \"D:20241218150537+08'00'\", 'Producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 24.5.96', 'Project': 'Singapore Electricity Market Rules', 'SourceModified': 'D:20241218070506', 'Status': 'Release 3.0c', 'Subject': '', 'Title': 'Singapore Electricity Market Rules'}, page_content='Singapore Electricity Market Rules Energy\\nChapter 6 Market\\n1 January 2025 Authority\\n2.1.3 Dispatch network lines and dispatch network nodes need not correspond\\nexactly to physical electricity lines or nodes. In establishing or updating\\nthe requirements for dispatch network data the EMC may, in consultation\\nwith the PSO, simplify or expand the representation of the physical\\nnetwork in ways that do not materially affect scheduling, pricing or\\nsettlement, but that simplify the scheduling, pricing or settlement\\nprocesses.\\nExplanatory Note: The dispatch network is used to determine the schedules\\nused by the PSO and determines the prices which the EMC applies, possibly\\nwith transformations, to market network nodes. For this reason, both the\\nEMC and the PSO must have input to the dispatch network representation.\\n2.1.4 The PSO shall specify and publish, prior to the market commencement\\ndate, and shall thereafter maintain, update and re-publish as required, any\\ngeneric constraints that are likely to arise, which generic constraints shall\\nbe consistent with the generic constraint equations in Appendix 6D.\\n2.1.5 The PSO shall, prior to the market commencement date:\\n2.1.5.1 establish the minimum total requirements for each reserve class\\nin accordance with section 4.5.3 of Chapter 5;\\n2.1.5.2 establish the total requirements for regulation in accordance\\nwith section 4.4.4 of Chapter 5;\\n2.1.5.3 establish reserve provider groups, each of which is associated\\nwith a single reserve class, and the criteria by which\\nprospective reserve providers will be assigned to such reserve\\nprovider groups in accordance with section 4.6.1 of Chapter 5;\\nand\\n2.1.5.4 establish parameters describing the effectiveness of each\\nreserve provider group in meeting the reserve requirements for\\nits reserve class in accordance with section 4.6.3 of Chapter 5,\\nand shall thereafter maintain and update as required the elements described\\nin this section 2.1.5.\\n2.1.6 The PSO shall update all data and elements described in sections 2.1.2 to\\n2.1.5:\\n2.1.6.1 in the manner and at the times required by this Chapter; and\\n2.1.6.2 in any event, in a timely fashion as may otherwise be required\\nto reflect temporary or permanent changes in the structure,\\ncapacity and operation of the PSO controlled system.\\nPage 10\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Chapter 6 Market Operation 1Jan25.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Chapter 6 Market Operation 1Jan25.pdf', 'page': 11, 'total_pages': 60, 'Author': 'Energy Market Authority', 'Chapter Number': 'Chapter 6', 'Client': 'Energy Market Authority', 'Company': '', 'CreationDate': \"D:20241218150523+08'00'\", 'Creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 24 for Word', 'Date': '10 January 2002', 'Keywords': '', 'ModDate': \"D:20241218150537+08'00'\", 'Producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 24.5.96', 'Project': 'Singapore Electricity Market Rules', 'SourceModified': 'D:20241218070506', 'Status': 'Release 3.0c', 'Subject': '', 'Title': 'Singapore Electricity Market Rules'}, page_content='Singapore Electricity Market Rules Energy\\nChapter 6 Market\\n1 January 2025 Authority\\n2.1.7 The PSO shall, prior to the market commencement date, establish such\\nsystems and procedures, and train such staff, as may be necessary to allow\\nthe PSO to provide to the EMC, on a continuous basis as required by\\nsections 6.1 and 8.1, the data referred to in those sections so as to enable\\nthe EMC to determine forecasts and schedules in accordance with this\\nChapter.\\n2.2 IMPORT AND EXPORT LIMITS\\n2.2.1 The Authority shall, prior to the market commencement date, establish an\\nimport limit for Singapore, which shall be a limit on the total net energy\\nflows into Singapore across all connections, including interties, from\\nfacilities outside of Singapore.

Thus a dispatch network\\nnode (DNN) with no load or generation will not be represented as a MNN. A\\nMNN will be associated with each different schedulable resource to be settled.\\nThus if there are 5 different meters corresponding to different facilities at a\\ndispatch network node then there will need to be 5 MNNs associated with\\nthat dispatch network node. While this feature has been defined to allow\\nmaximum generality, the fact that loads are settled at a single location (the\\nSHUB) will mean that the distinction between MNNs and DNNs will be most\\nrelevant for generators.\\n3.1.1 The EMC shall define a set of market network nodes or MNN having the\\nfollowing characteristics:\\n3.1.1.1 at each market network node there shall be either a single\\nrevenue quality meter measuring all relevant flows into or out\\nof that market network node, or a process by which the flows\\nmeasured by one or more revenue quality meters can be\\ntransformed to determine the deemed flow at that market\\nnetwork node; and\\n3.1.1.2 each market network node shall be associated with only one\\nmarket participant.\\n3.1.2 Only one market participant shall, for settlement purposes, be assigned to\\nand responsible for making or receiving settlement amounts in respect of\\nthe metered flow or the deemed flow at a given MNN.\\n3.1.3 The EMC shall:\\n3.1.3.1 establish the necessary parameters for relating dispatch network\\nnodes and market network nodes to all generation registered\\nfacilities, import registered facilities and generation settlement\\nfacilities in accordance with section D.7 of Appendix 6D;\\n3.1.3.2 develop software and procedures to perform the price\\ntransformations described in sections D.7 and D.24 of\\nAppendix 6D; and\\n3.1.3.3 publish the names of the market network nodes and the identity\\nof the revenue quality meter assigned to each market network\\nnode.\\nPage 13\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Chapter 6 Market Operation 1Jan25.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Chapter 6 Market Operation 1Jan25.pdf', 'page': 14, 'total_pages': 60, 'Author': 'Energy Market Authority', 'Chapter Number': 'Chapter 6', 'Client': 'Energy Market Authority', 'Company': '', 'CreationDate': \"D:20241218150523+08'00'\", 'Creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 24 for Word', 'Date': '10 January 2002', 'Keywords': '', 'ModDate': \"D:20241218150537+08'00'\", 'Producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 24.5.96', 'Project': 'Singapore Electricity Market Rules', 'SourceModified': 'D:20241218070506', 'Status': 'Release 3.0c', 'Subject': '', 'Title': 'Singapore Electricity Market Rules'}, page_content='Singapore Electricity Market Rules Energy\\nChapter 6 Market\\n1 January 2025 Authority\\n3.1.4 The EMC shall maintain and update as required the elements described in\\nsection 3.1.3, including publishing changes to any information previously\\npublished pursuant to section 3.1.3.3.\\n3.2 FORECASTING SYSTEMS\\n3.2.1 The EMC shall establish such systems and procedures, and train such staff,\\nas may be necessary to allow the EMC to transform, on a regular basis as\\nrequired by sections 7.2.1 and 9.1.1, load and solar generation forecasts\\nfor Singapore received from the PSO for each dispatch period into nodal\\nload forecasts for the same dispatch period.
